",3,0,20,120,"Currently there are only FADs in the USVI around St. Thomas and St. John. The number of active fishing vessels is an estimate of both commercial and recreational fishing vessels. Commercial fishers are required to report their fishing activity, but in St. Thomas and St. John, they fish mostly traps (not at FADs), though some fish with hook and line gear at the FADs. Recreational anglers do fish the FADs but it is not required at this time for them to report their fishing activity and landings. The reporting program is currently being developed to expand reporting efforts by recreational anglers in the USVI, which includes those who fish at the FADs. "
